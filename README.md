# 👋 Hey there, I'm Vinayak Bandhu

### Web Developer | Code Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Full-Time Coffee Consumer ☕

I’m a **Web Developer** and **Coder** who spends more time with my laptop than I do with actual humans (don't judge me, it's cozy). My superpower? Turning coffee into code and making websites that actually work—most of the time. I specialize in the **MERN Stack** because it's like the Avengers of web development: fast, flexible, and ready to save the day.

I love exploring new tech, solving problems (or creating new ones), and transforming random thoughts into websites that *hopefully* don’t break on launch day. If you’ve got an idea or just want to talk about the deep existential crisis of debugging, I’m your person. Let’s create something cool, or at least something that looks decent when you squint!

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack:

### **Languages:**
- **C** – The OG language, the one that made me question my sanity (and my sleep schedule).
- **C++** – Because who doesn't love an extra dose of complexity? *Polymorphism for breakfast?*
- **Java** – It's like the coffee of programming languages; keeps me awake but has a lot of boilerplate.
- **Python** – The language that makes me feel like a wizard (but also like a beginner at the same time).
- **JavaScript** – If you like living on the edge and playing with infinite loops, this one’s for you.

### **Web Development:**
- **HTML5** – I make the web look pretty, one `<div>` at a time.
- **CSS3** – The part where I pretend I know what I’m doing with `flexbox` and `grid`.
- **JavaScript** – It’s like the crazy friend in the group, but somehow, it always gets things done.
- **ReactJS** – Building UI components with React is like assembling Lego sets. But, you know, more complex.
- **NodeJS** – It's like a party in the back-end, and everyone’s invited (especially the non-blocking I/O).
- **ExpressJS** – Routing is fun, said no one ever, until Express came along.
- **MongoDB** – Where I store data in a way that doesn't need rigid tables because we're *cool* like that.
- **PHP** – Old but gold, just like that one pair of socks you keep around for emergencies.

### **Tools & Tech:**
- **Git** – I blame Git every time something breaks. "It’s Git’s fault!"
- **Photoshop** – For when I need to make a logo but don't have the budget for a designer. *Just kidding, I’m not that bad.*
- **VS Code** – My best friend and sometimes my worst enemy. The amount of plugins I have installed is... alarming.
- **Nginx** – The server that makes me feel like a server administrator without the real responsibilities.
